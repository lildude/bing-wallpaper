Bing Wallpaper for Mac and Ubuntu
=================================

Information
-----------
A script which downloads the latest picture of the day from Bing.com and saves
it to a directory.

The script was tested on:

- Mac OS X 10.8 - 10.12, 10.15, 11.5

How to use?

download today's bing image.

                                 Will be created if it does not exist.

Dependencies
------------
The script uses [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to parse json output from Bing.com. Installation instructions can be found on [jq's download page](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/).

Configuration on Mac
--------------------
* Open Mac's `System Preferences` -> `Desktop & Screensaver`, add the wallpaper
directory, and configure to taste.

* To have the script run everyday automatically you will need to setup
launchd. I have provided a sample plist file, found in the `Tools`
directory, which can be copied to `$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents` and
loaded with the command `launchctl load $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ideasftw.bing-wallpaper.plist`. Modify
the plist as needed to point to `bing-wallpaper.sh`.

Configuration on Ubuntu
-----------------------
**TL;DR:**

* To install Gnome background slideshow, in the terminal run:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:thejandroman/bing-wallpaper.git
$ bing-wallpaper/Tools/gnome-bing-slideshow/deploy-gnome-settings.sh
```

* Register `bing-wallpaper/bing-random-pic.sh` to run regularly.

* Change the background properties to use the new slideshow.

**How to register bing-wallpaper.sh or bing-random-pic.sh to run regularly.**

There are two ways to run the scipts regularly: cron jobs and startup
applications.
* Cron jobs:
  * Change the path of `bing-wallpaper.sh` in `Tools/bing-cron` to the
    desired script location. If left unchanged the default value is
    `~/Pictures/bing-wallpaper.sh`.
  * From the terminal run `crontab /path/to/bing-cron` to setup the cronjob.
* Startup programs:
  * From HUD, search for startup applications.
  * Add `bing-random-pic.sh` or `bing-wallpaper.sh`.
